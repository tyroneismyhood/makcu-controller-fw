**Support development:** [Support MAKCU Controller Firmware through Stripe]()

Optional support payments help fund continued firmware development, hardware testing, accessibility tools, documentation, and project expenses. The firmware remains available under its existing licenses.

See [Project and Payment Support](SUPPORT.md) for technical-support and payment information.

## Releases

See the [Releases page](https://github.com/Oso-Cute/makcu-controller-fw/releases)
for downloadable merged Left/Right firmware images.

**Connecting controllers to a PC?** See the
[PC Connection Guide](docs/PC_CONNECTION_GUIDE.md) — step-by-step for the
Elite (1698), One S (1708), and Series X (1914).

- **0.60** — (PC) PS4 V2 controller (DualShock 4) support: sticks, triggers, face buttons, L1/R1 all inject. DS4/DS5 layout auto-detected; `km.ds4(1|0|-1)` to override. Flash BOTH bins, then hard power-cycle the board.
- **0.50** — (PC ) Multi-model Xbox controller support: Elite (1698), One S (1708), Series X (1914). Please wait 3 minutes and dont spam the xbox button just press it once. Elite Series 2 (1797) untested — needs a tester.
- **0.40** — (XboxSX) Controller + mouse through a bus-powered USB hub (keyboard/mouse host support). See release notes for hub power rules and the 8-channel budget.
- ~~**0.30**~~ — **removed due to bugs**, do not flash
- **0.20** — (XboxSX) Works for offical xbox controller on xbox seriex x
- **0.10** — (PC) Works for 2 pc and ps5 controller

## Support the project

MAKCU Controller Firmware is an independently maintained open-source project from **Keyrose Creative**.

The repository, firmware releases, documentation, and included tools are available without requiring payment. Users who find the project useful may optionally support continued development through Stripe:

[**Support MAKCU Controller Firmware development →**]()

Support payments may be used toward:

- MAKCU and controller hardware for compatibility testing
- Firmware development and debugging
- Accessibility-tool development
- Documentation and release preparation
- Software services and other project expenses

A support payment does not purchase firmware, hardware, a software license, ownership, equity, guaranteed technical support, guaranteed compatibility, or influence over the project roadmap.

For payment questions, contact **Keyrose Creative**.

The MAKCM (dual-ESP32-S3 "MAKCU" board) **game controller passthrough
firmware** shipped unfinished. This repo carries the fixes needed to make it
work end-to-end, plus a small Python GUI for quick testing.

The device sits between a real controller and the target console/PC, passes
the controller through transparently, and exposes a serial command channel
that the Python tools use to add assistance.

> **Not an official MAKCU project.** This is based on the
> `MAKCM_Pass_Package` example firmware released by the MAKCM/MAKCU author,
> which was published explicitly as unfinished example code. See
> [docs/legal/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](docs/legal/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)
> for credits and licensing status.

## What was fixed

The stock package firmware did not deliver any controller input. Getting it
working required three fixes (full write-up in
[docs/ISSUE_REPORT.md](docs/ISSUE_REPORT.md)):

1. **Both MCUs must be flashed** with the matching firmware pair — they share
   a custom IPC protocol, and a board fresh from the vendor is running
   different stock firmware on the Right MCU.
2. **The Right MCU needs a full power-cycle after flashing** or it stays
   silent.
3. **GIP init handshake implemented** on the Right MCU — Xbox One (GIP)
   controllers never leave their "announce" loop without it, so no input ever
   flows. This is the main firmware change in this repo.

On top of that, the Left MCU gained accessibility features: a steady
(anti-tremor) filter, stick-drift trim, live telemetry, and button hold/toggle
latches, all controllable over the serial command port.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `firmware/` | The two PlatformIO projects (Left = ESP-IDF, Right = Arduino + ESP-IDF usb_host), a guided flash tool, and prebuilt merged images in `firmware/bin/`. |
| `accessibility/` | Python control layer: tabbed GUI, tremor monitor, serial wrapper + foot-pedal example. Start here for day-to-day use. |
| `tools/` | Extras — `button_mapper.py` logs which telemetry bit each controller button sets, so the GUI Monitor can show button names. |
| `docs/` | [ISSUE_REPORT.md](docs/ISSUE_REPORT.md) — the debugging write-up; [UPSTREAM_PACKAGE_README.md](docs/UPSTREAM_PACKAGE_README.md) — the original package README, kept as the technical reference for the passthrough internals. |
| `FLASHING.md` | How to flash **both** MCUs, step by step. |

## Requirements

- **Hardware:** a MAKCM/MAKCU board (two ESP32-S3, 4 MB flash, three USB
  ports), a wired controller, and a PC for flashing and the Python tools.
  Tested on one setup: MAKCM board + wired Xbox One (GIP) controller + Xbox
  console + Windows 11 PC. Other combinations should work per the upstream
  docs but are unverified here.
- **To flash prebuilt images:** Python 3.10+ — download the Windows installer
  from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and check
  **"Add python.exe to PATH"** during install. Then `pip install pyserial esptool`.
- **To build from source:** [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) CLI
  (`pip install platformio` or the VS Code extension). The ESP-IDF toolchain
  is downloaded automatically on first build.
- **For the accessibility tools:** `pip install pyserial pynput`.

## Quick start

1. **Flash both MCUs.** Easiest: `python firmware/flash_tool.py` (guided GUI,
   uses the prebuilt images in `firmware/bin/`). Or follow
   [FLASHING.md](FLASHING.md) manually. **Both sides must be flashed** —
   Left-only or Right-only will not work.
2. **Power-cycle everything** (unplug all cables, wait a few seconds, replug).
   The Right MCU will not run new firmware until this is done.
3. **Connect for use:** PC → middle port (USB2, the CH343 command port),
   console/PC → left port (USB1), controller → right port (USB3).
4. **Verify:** `python accessibility/makcu_access.py` — expect a
   `kmbox: 1.0.0 …` handshake line.
5. **Use the GUI:** `python accessibility/makcu_gui.py` — see
   [accessibility/README.md](accessibility/README.md).

## Build from source

```bash
# Left MCU — quiet build (use this for play):
PLATFORMIO_BUILD_FLAGS="-DCOM3_LOG=0 -DKM_DIAG=0 -DKM_RING=0 -DLAT_DIAG=0" \
  pio run -d firmware/MAKCM_ESP32s3_Pass_Left_IDF -e LEFT_IDF

# Left MCU — log build (diagnostics only; floods the command port):
pio run -d firmware/MAKCM_ESP32s3_Pass_Left_IDF -e LEFT_IDF

# Right MCU:
pio run -d firmware/MAKCM_ESP32s3_Pass_Right -e RIGHT
```

Flashing details, port identification, download-mode buttons, and the
expected-but-scary `Error 1` at the end of an upload are all covered in
[FLASHING.md](FLASHING.md).

## Rollback / recovery

Vendor stock binaries are **not** included in this repo. If you want a way
back to stock, save the vendor images **before** flashing and keep them
somewhere safe; `FLASHING.md` documents where to put them
(`firmware/bin/stock/`) and how to restore them. The ESP32-S3 ROM bootloader
itself is in mask ROM and survives any app flash — worst case you re-flash
over the same ports.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Flashing firmware can leave your device non-functional if it goes wrong, and
this project is provided **as-is, with no warranty — use at your own risk**.
It was tested on exactly one hardware setup. It is not an official MAKCU
release and is not endorsed by the original author unless upstream says
otherwise. Console behavior (including whether a console tolerates a
passthrough device) is your responsibility to verify. Full version:
